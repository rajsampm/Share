   INTERVAL TREE

   * Use case *
   We use Interval tree when we have a set of intervals
   and we need to make operations on these intervals like
   add a new interval or find if a given interval Xleft, Xright
   overlaps with any interval in the tree.

   * Implementaion Note*
   We can implement a  Binary Search Tree to
   maintain the intervals and with that we
   can do all the above operations in log(n) time.

   * Structure of a node *
   Every node will contain two integers (left) and (right)
   which correspond to the interval represented by the current
   node. Also each node will contain one more integer (high) which
   holds the max right  value of its generations.

   * Implementation *
   we will use
